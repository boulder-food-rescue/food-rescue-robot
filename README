Boudle Food Rescue Web App
==========================

Installation
------------

1. Make sure you have ruby installed.
2. Make sure you have ImageMagick installed by running `which convert` (the paperclip plugin needs this).
2. Grab the [source code](https://github.com/somerandomsequence/food-rescue-robot).
3. Run `bundle update` to pull in all the required gems.
4. Copy `config/database.yml.dist` to `config/database.yml` and edit the `development` configuration as desired (defaults to sqlite).
5. Create the database by running `rake db:migrate`
6. Fire up the app by running `rails sever` and then hit http://localhost:3000/ to see if it works

Setting Up an Admin User
------------------------

1. Click the `sign up` link and create an account
2. Go into your database and change the `volunteer.admin` value for your account to `true` (or do this via the rails console).
3. Go back to the website, login, and edit your list of regions on `http://localhost:3000/regions`
4. Click on your name, and edit your settings - add yourself to the region you just created

Development Notes
-----------------

Models:
   
   Volunteer (people, user accounts, you know...)
   Location (donors and recipients)
   Schedule (associates a volunteer, time, recipient & donor)
   Log (log entry for each scheduled pick-up)

Rake directives (eventually to be called on crontabs)

  foodrobot:generate_logs - generates logs for today (run at 1am?)
  foodrobot:send_reminders - sends out reminder emails for any outstanding logs (run at midnight?)

Outside of the normal rails-fu, this project uses...

  active_scaffold (all over the damn place)
  devise (on the Volunteer model)
  geocoder (on the Location model)

Initial scaffolding was generated with these commands

rails generate active_scaffold Volunteer email:string name:string phone:string preferred_contact:string transport:string has_car:boolean admin_notes:text pickup_prefs:text gone_until:date is_disabled:boolean on_email_list:boolean

rails generate active_scaffold Location is_donor:boolean recip_category:string donor_type:string address:text name:string lat:decimal lng:decimal contact:text website:string admin_notes:text public_notes:text hours:text

rails generate active_scaffold Schedule recipient_id:integer donor_id:integer volunteer:references prior_volunteer_id:integer day_of_week:integer time_start:integer time_stop:integer admin_notes:text public_notes:text needs_training:boolean

rails generate active_scaffold Log schedule:references when:date volunteer:references orig_volunteer_id:integer weight:decimal description:text transport:string notes:text num_reminders:integer flag_for_admin:boolean weighed_by:string
